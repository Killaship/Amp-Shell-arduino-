# Amp-Shell-arduino

The Amp shell is a project for Arduino, preferably a high power board, like the ESP32, because Amp will use up a lot of ram with lists, and buffers, and etc.
I'm going to make a GNU/Linux-like thing for Arduino, which will be called AmpOS, using the Amp shell. This is a repo for the open-source project.

# Documentation/User Manual

help - Displays the available commands and their uses.
systemreq - displays System Requirements for running Amp.
echo - "echoes" back the argument provided. Usage: echo *String* (NOT IMPLEMENTED YET)



# Development 

Done: CLI, help command, systemreq command
Bugs: All commands return "Invalid command." System unusable.
Unfinished: Everything else, argument provision system.




# No warrantly, bla bla bla, please somebody tell me how to run separate processes/programs, by running a pre-compiled file in the SPIFFS filesystem.
